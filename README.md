c2cb -> Check 2 Check Budgeting
====

Just a simple budget keeping project. For me this is a means of mapping my budget, living check to check sucks.. not keeping track of what gets spent when where and how, breaking the bank and bouncing checks is far more worse. Queue this little project of mine. I intend on offering a free hosted version of this sooner or later. But this repo is intended for those who want to self host it. I am not sure what licensing I will publish under as of yet, but currently this is free for all, with no expressed warranty or guarantees what so ever.
